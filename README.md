## ðŸ”§ Task 2: Method Optimization

For the second task, I optimized the `inefficientMethod`. The improvements include:

### Key Optimizations:

-  Using `findOrFail` for better error handling
-  Implementing eager loading with `with('certificate')` to prevent N+1 queries
-  Replacing manual loops with performant collection methods
-  Using `pluck` to directly extract certificates from courses
-  Applying `values()` to reset array keys in the returned collections

These enhancements should help boost the method's performance and improve code readability.
